# goodnight-world
What if instead of hello, the application said "goodnight"?

This is a fun little "now what?" project that came to life during dinner conversation about my life after bootcamp. 
It's already two weeks post graduation and I haven't done much "fun" coding since - just hackerrank and leetcode assessments 
to try to bridge that gap between what I learned from class & what employers are looking for in a junior software developer. 
My partner encouraged me to try something, anything, even something as simple as a "hello world". So I said, how about a "goodnight world" 
that shuts down your computer? It was silly but not so hard that I couldn't try to write it. (Everything seems really hard
and complicated when you're no longer protected by the perfect coding environment bootcamp set up for you..)

Anyway, this app is really annoying. You'll get a popup saying "goodnight" and then your computer will shut down. 

At least, that is what it is supposed to do.
**Edit: it worked
